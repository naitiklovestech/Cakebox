# Cakebox - Employee Attendance Android Application

Cakebox is an innovative Android application designed for employee attendance management. The app ensures that employees can only mark their attendance when they are within a specified location range and submit a front camera image for verification. This approach provides an added layer of security and accountability to attendance tracking, especially for businesses where location-based verification is crucial.

- The database is structured using Firebase for real-time data updates and Room DB for local storage when offline.

### 4. **Firebase Integration**
- Firebase is being integrated for user authentication and secure data storage.
- Attendance data is securely stored and synced in real-time with the Firebase Realtime Database.

### 5. **Admin Panel Development**
- The admin panel will allow administrators to manage users, view attendance, and verify the photo submissions of employees.
- Development for the panel is pending and will be handled using React.js and Appwrite for the backend.

### 6. **Application Frontend**
- The frontend development is currently underway, focusing on creating a smooth and responsive user experience.
- The frontend is built with Kotlin, utilizing Android Jetpack components to ensure modularity and maintainability.

### 7. **Application Backend**
- The backend development will involve integrating the app with Appwrite to handle user management, admin controls, and other backend services.
- Backend development is scheduled to start after the completion of the frontend.

### 8. **Project Delivery**
- The final delivery of the project is expected once all the above phases are completed and thoroughly tested.
